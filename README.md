# first-come-first-served
In this Java data structure, it emulates a queue system similar to the one found at a phone service store. Customers are added to the queue in the order they arrive, following the "first come, first served" principle. Customers are removed from the queue when they receive assistance or if they decide to leave the store prematurely. This input and interaction with the queue are managed by a customer service representative, who acts as the user of the system.

Whenever a change occurs in the queue, the system automatically prints out the updated queue status. These changes encompass two main actions:

Adding a New Customer: When a new customer arrives, they are added to the end of the queue.

Serving a Customer: When a customer is ready to be helped, they are removed from the front of the queue, and the positions of the remaining customers in the queue are updated accordingly.

This Java data structure facilitates the management of customer queues, making it easy to track and serve customers in a sequential order, mirroring the operation of a real-world phone service store.
